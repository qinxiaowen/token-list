The DApp Rosetta Developer Community is a non-profit, decentralized autonomous organization that is self-organized by a group of passionate and enthusiastic DApp developers who aim to popularize the practical knowledge of smart contract development and contribute sample smart contract codes regularly. DApp Rosetta will issue its own token DRT in order to implement community autonomy.
